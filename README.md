# meals_app

A new Flutter project. Meals app is a flutter app that displays a list of meals and their recipes. It also allows you to filter the meals based on your preferences.

## Things I have learned and used:
- How to use `Navigation` to navigate between screens.
- How to use `Stack` to stack widgets.
- How to build more complex widgets and screens.
- How to use new widgets such as `InkWell`, `Positioned`, `Grid` and `MaterialPageRoute`.
- How to use `BottomNavigationBar` and `TabBar` to navigate between screens.
